# The 'for' keyword initiates the loop 
for i in range(5): 
    # The 'range(5)' defines the sequence we're iterating over, which is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
    # 'i' is the iteration variable that holds the current item's value in the sequence 
    print(i) # The code block executed for each item. Here it prints the current value of 'i'.
