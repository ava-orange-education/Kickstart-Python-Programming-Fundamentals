# Initiation: Set the starting point of the countdown 
counter = 5 
# While keyword initiates the loop 
while counter > 0: # The condition to be checked before each loop iteration 
    # Execution: The code block that executes as long as the condition is true 
    print(counter) # This line prints the current value of 'counter' 
    # Progression: Decrement the counter to eventually meet the loop termination condition 
    counter -= 1 
# Conclusion: The loop ends when the condition is false (counter is no longer greater than 0) 
print("Countdown finished!")
